Declares functions and macros to handle U\+T\+F-\/8 streams.  


Declares functions and macros to handle U\+T\+F-\/8 streams. 

All U\+T\+F-\/8 streams are made of a pointer to a sequence of bytes and the length of that sequence.

Two utility macros are used to help write less code.

This module provides functions to compare U\+T\+F-\/8 streams with other U\+T\+F-\/8 streams and A\+S\+C\+II strings.

There is also a function to iterate over the characters of a U\+T\+F-\/8 stream.
